# 🌲 Random Forest Classification Project 

## 📌 Overview 
This repository contains scripts for training and evaluating a **Random Forest Classifier**. The workflow includes **feature engineering**, **data preprocessing**, **train-test split**, and **model training/prediction**. 
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. 

## ⚙️ Requirements 
- Python 3.8+
- - Libraries:
  - - `numpy`
    -  `pandas`
    -  `scikit-learn`
    -  `matplotlib` (optional, for visualization)

## 🛠 Workflow
1. Feature Engineering
2. Train-Test Split (train_test_split.py)
3. Model Training
4. Prediction & Evaluation

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
1. Accuracy: Overall correctness of predictions.
2. Classification report : Precision, Recall, F1-score.
3. Confusion Matrix: To check prediction errors.
